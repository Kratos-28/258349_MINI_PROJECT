# MINI PROJECT FOR STEP IN LTTS

## Introduction
The idea of this project is to learn about various sorting techniques and its advantage in different situation.By completing this project, I will bring all the concepts of C programming that I have so far during my STEPIN program in practice.

## Features of project
- Generating Random Integers 
- File handling
- Execution Time in C
- Sorting Techniques

## Description
Objective of the project is to find the best sorting algorithm in different test cases.So first I am generating random integers and store it in a file and after that reterive the numbers and store it into array and apply different sorting algorithms to it after that we are going to calculate the execution time and compare for each sorting algorithm and print the output where the execution time is less.
