# MINI PROJECT FOR STEP IN LTTS

##Introduction
The idea of this project is to learn about various sorting techniques and its advantage in different situation.So,First I am generating random integers and storing that integers in file(csv).
After that using different sorting algorithms we are going to caluclate the execution time for each and store it in other file for comparison. After that comparing each execution time and finding the less time and print the output.
